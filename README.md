# Importance of Translation 

In order to communicate effectively between cultures, translation is essential. Information, knowledge, and ideas spread across the globe through translation. During the process of spreading new information, translation can have a profound impact on history. 

# Creating Translation Model 

The model finetuned for Text translation is Helsinki NLP opus mt-en-fr. It is a is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model implemented in Transformer library.  

# Dataset 

The dataset used for Fine tuning the model Helsinki NLP opus mt-en-fr is KDE4 dataset. A total of 92 languages are available for this dataset. There are 210,173 pairs of sentences in the KDE dataset, but in one single split, so we will need to create our own validation set.
